\arguments{
\item{object}{A CellLabeler object}

\item{sample.var}{Column names of sample information in metadata.}

\item{cluster.var}{Column names of cluster information in metadata.}

\item{features}{Feature names. Default is NULL, then all features will be used.}

\item{markers}{A list of markers; names of the list should be cell type names;}

\item{similar.gene}{Integer value as the number of top expressed genes in considering combining clusters before DE test}

\item{similar.pct}{Numeric value in \link{0,1} as the threshold to combine clusters before DE test when either two cluster have enough overlapped highly expressed genes. Default is 0.8.}

\item{lfc}{Limit testing to genes which show the maximum on average X-fold difference (log-scale) between the interested clusters and the rest others. Default is 0.5.}

\item{max.genes}{Maximum number of highly expressed genes in each cluster required. Default is 100.}

\item{min.ccells}{Minimum number of cells in each cluster required. Default is 10.}

\item{max.cellsp}{Maximum downsamplng ratio (from 0 to 1); if NULL than all cells will be used in computation}

\item{up.thr}{Numberic value in \link{0,1} as the proportion of the remaining clusters in which a gene is upregulated in the interested group compared with it. Higher, the more strict. Default 0.9.}

\item{mod}{Character as "combine" or "all", specifying if combining similar clusters or not before DE test. Default is "combine"}

\item{num.core}{Number of cores in multi-threaded running. Default is 1.}

\item{verbose}{Bool indicator to print the messages}
